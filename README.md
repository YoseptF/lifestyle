## How to run locally

### If you are a reviewer and for some reason can't get a [gamespot api](https://www.gamespot.com/api/), you can contact me on slack to get mine ðŸ˜‰

0. Before attempting this process, you'll need:
   - `ruby 2.7.0`
   - `rails 6` 
   - an API from [gamespot](https://www.gamespot.com/api/), if you want to load the seed (It is free, and you don't even need to _*register*_, you can just login with google, and grab the key)

1. Clone this repository
    ```
    $ git clone git@github.com:YoseptF/lifestyle.git
    ```
2. cd into the directory (you may need to checkout to other branch depending on what you are attempting to do)
    ```
    $ cd lifestyle/
    ```
3. bundle
    ```
    $ bundle install
    ```
4. yarn install
    ```
    $ yarn install --check-files
    ```
5. Migrate and seed (if you don't need the seed you can skip that one)
    
    5.1 if you want to seed you need to add your [gamespot api](https://www.gamespot.com/api/) in a file `.env` like this:
    ```
    GAMESPOT_API=your_api_key
    ```
    5.2 migrate and seed
    ```
    $ rails db:migrate db:seed
    ```
6. Open you browser on `localhost:3000 or 127.0.0.1:3000`

7. (optional) This project uses Azure for active storage on production, if you want to use it, you need to add the following api keys in your `.env` file:
    ```
    AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME=your_storage_account
    AZURE_STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY=your_access_key
    AZURE_STORAGE_CONTAINER=your_storage_container
    ```
    or you can change from `:azure` to `:local` in the `production.rb`
